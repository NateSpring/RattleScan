# RattleScan
This app is for placing markers where you spot a venemous Rattlesnake. The goal is to help other users avoid these areas and ultimately avoid harm. 
On this project I learned to use the Google Maps API + Places API to display a map and allow users to make a marker with a search box. Additionally I prepopulated the map with my own sightings of Rattlesnakes. Overall this was a very fun project to work on and I hope it can help people in the future.
